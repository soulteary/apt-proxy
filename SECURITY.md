## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

1. **Private disclosure (preferred)**  
   Open a **private security advisory** on GitHub: [Security Advisories](https://github.com/soulteary/apt-proxy/security/advisories/new).  
   This allows us to fix the issue and coordinate disclosure before it is made public.

2. **Public disclosure**  
   You may open a public issue if you prefer; please avoid including proof-of-concept or exploit details that could put others at risk before a fix is available.

We will acknowledge your report and work with you on a fix and disclosure timeline. Thank you for helping keep apt-proxy and its users safe.
